# 6502-CPU
Emulated the original 6502 Chip to specification, able to visualize running with a text-edit interface and full 64kb memory space, capable of running any 6502 assembly program without interrupt handling

If you dont know much about the 6502 CPU and its derivatives, they power some cool machines such as 
  - Apple II
  - Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
  - Atari 2600
  - BBC Micro
  - etc 

- Trying to learn how a CPU functions by emulating one myself 
- Would be a good idea to implement
  - unit tests (near future)
  - handle decimal mode
  - illegal opcodes
  - 100% cycle accuracy
  - hardware glitches
